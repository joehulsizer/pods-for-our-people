## ðŸš¨ CURRENT PRIORITY: Fix TypeScript Errors for Production

**Build Error Details:**
```
223:36 Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type. @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
383:36 Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type. @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
80:6 Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'mediaRef'. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix all instances of 'any' type usage in NotificationSystem.tsx by replacing with proper types
2. Fix the missing useEffect dependency in PodcastPlayer.tsx
3. Ensure the code builds successfully for production
4. Commit the fixes and push to GitHub
5. Verify successful Netlify deployment

**Goal:** Get the production build to pass so the app can deploy successfully to Netlify and the user can clone/develop/push workflow works perfectly.
